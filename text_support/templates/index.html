<!---

The html for the homepage explaining how `text_support` works. Eventually we
will have both a `layout.html` and an `index.html` page like [this
example](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/master/examples/flaskr/templates).

{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
<h1>Welcome to Text Support!</h1>
<p>We continuously deploy now.</p>
{% endblock %}
