# 01 - Intro

Welcome to the documentation for
[text_support](https://github.com/hackmh/text_support). Read below for more info
on how to utilize this documentation. It should provide everything you need to
get started!

## Using the Documentation

**text_support**, and all hackMH projects, contain two different types of
documentation. The first is documentation within code source files. This
documentation describes fine level implementation details, including the input
and output of methods, functions of classes, and descriptions of extraordinary
behaviors/decisions. The source level documentation is a great resource when
interacting with the code - either for fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or
just seeking a greater understanding.

The second type of documentation, found in the `docs/` directory, is much higher
level. It describes higher level processes such as set up, developing,
deploying, and the workings of higher level features.
In the name of transparency, it also
includes descriptions of the thought process behind the major decisions driving
development of **text_support**.

Both the source and `docs` documentation aim to make it easy for users to
contribute to **text_support**. If you ever think of any changes to the
documentation to further this goal, please make a pull request!
